# March-3-Make-Up
makeup assignment for March 3 class


The class on March 3, 2018 continued to cover concepts related to Javascript and jQuery. 
Scott walked us through tehe Captain Planet game to show how JS and jQuery work together. 
Additionally, as we went through the code of the game, he pointed out how we can save time
and functionality by implementing jQuery frameworks rather than JS.

Scott tried to help the class better understand how jQuery works by breaking it down its 
basic setup. Essentially, you can use the jQuery identifier to capture html elements, decide
how we want to capture the element, and finally add a jQuery method to change the element.
We used this framework to code the Fridge magnet game.

This class also went over scope and how parent and child functions interact with one another.
Although difficult to comprehend at first, we went through three scope activities and used
console log to see how some functions were able to call to one another and others outputted
undefined variables. Essentially, nested (child) functions can call variables that were defined
in parent/outer/global functions, but the parent function cannot call variables in the nested
functions.
